                    <p>Faizah and older sister Asiya shop with Mama for a new hijab for Asiya. Tomorrow is the sisters’ first day back to school. For the first time, sixth grader Asiya will wear hijab at school, and Faizah is thrilled with Asiya’s choice of a beautiful, blue hijab. The next day, Faizah feels special with her new backpack and light-up shoes. When she sees Asiya in her first-day hijab, Faizah beams with pride. Arriving at school, Asiya leaves Faizah with the younger children and joins the sixth graders. Faizah is full of hope and excitement, but when a classmate asks her what her sister has on her head, Faizah timidly whispers an answer. Faizah catches herself, imagining that her sister’s hijab “isn’t a whisper,” but blue and wonderful as the sky. She recalls her mother’s words that the first day of wearing hijab is important. “It means being strong.” </p>

                    <p>To prompt thinking, talk about something in your life that makes you feel special. For example, “I feel special when someone tells me I’ve done a good job because it makes me feel proud about my work.” Use guiding questions such as the following to support discussion:
                        <br>-What is something that makes you feel special at school or at home? Why?<br>-How is this similar to or different from what makes Faizah and Asiya feel special on their first day of school?

                    <p>Feeling unsure of herself, Faizah runs to give Asiya a hug. Suddenly the sisters hear laughter. A boy is pointing at Asiya’s hijab. A confused Faizah asks, “Why?” She recalls her mother’s message that while some people will not understand the hijab, “if you understand who you are, one day they will too.” Later in class, Faizah draws a picture of two princesses in blue hijabs—her and Asiya. A classmate admires Faizah’s drawing. At recess, Faizah is back to feeling hopeful and excited. But once again, taunts aimed at Asiya upset Faizah. Asiya and her friends ignore the bullies. Faizah recalls more of her mother’s words, encouraging her not to hold on to hurtful words. These words, and seeing Asiya’s example, give Faizah the strength to walk away, too.</p>

                    <h3>Responding to Bullies</h3>
                    <p>The two episodes of bullying in this section show Faizah’s confusion in the face of intolerance and how Asiya’s sense of self and inner strength help both sisters deal with it. Guide students to compare and contrast the sisters’ reactions. Then have students reflect on their own feelings about bullying. Prompt discussion with guiding questions such as the following:</p>
                    <!-- <button class="blue-button mb20 activitySupport" popupref="popup-dr-1">Activity
                        Support</button> -->
                        <p>-How does Faizah feel when she first hears the bully laughing at Asiya? Why? <i>(Faizah doesn’t understand it; she can’t understand why others don’t see Asiya’s hijab the same way she does—proud and beautiful.)</i>
                            <br>-How are Faizah’s reactions to the bullying different from Asiya’s? <i>(Asiya and her friends calmly go back to playing tag; Faizah gets mad.)</i>
                            <br>-What might Faizah learn from Asiya about dealing with bullies? How does feeling proud help both girls? <i>(Faizah learns to stay proud of herself and ignore the bullies. This helps both Asiya and Faizah let go of the hurtful words.)</i>
                            <br>-Have you ever had to overcome a big challenge like this? How did it make you feel about yourself?
                        </p>
                        <p>You might share situations in your life where your own pride or sense of self helped you overcome a difficult situation. For example, “When I was in fifth grade, classmates made fun of me because they thought my singing sounded funny. I ignored them and just sang louder and prouder!” </p>
                   
                   <h3>Write About It!</h3>
                    <p><span class="bold">Journal</span> Display the following quote from the video of Ibtihaj Muhammad’s Q&A with children.  </p>
                    <p>“This hijab is part of me, and I’m not going to allow what someone else says to make me feel bad about myself. So, I learned to stand up tall and say, ‘This is who I am.’”</p>
                    <p>Point to the phrase “stand up tall.” Have students stand up next to their desks and try to stand up as tall as they can. Ask students what feeling they get when they are standing up as tall as they can. Do they feel confident or unsure? Brave or shy? Then ask students what they think Ibtihaj Muhammad means when she says “I learned to stand up tall and say, ‘This is who I am.’”</p>

                        <p>Then have students write about an experience they had “standing up tall” to face a difficult situation with confidence. </p>
                    <p>When <span class="longl">___________</span> , I stood up tall by <span class="longl">___________</span> .</p>
                    <p><i>If students need more prompting, work together to create a list of situations where it might help to “stand up tall.” You may also provide and display student exemplars. </i></p>
                    <p>Student Exemplars:<br> “When a classmate laughed at me for making a mistake in math class, I stood up tall by ignoring her and asking questions to learn from my mistake.” </p>
                    <p>“When my brother said I was too young to play on his soccer team, I stood up tall by convincing him to let me try.” </p>

                   <p>This “mockumentary” video stars two real-life ten-year-old Muslim American twin sisters—one of whom is certain that her sister is an alien!</p>

                    <p>Draw students’ attention to the text on the last two pages of the story. Discuss what Faizah means when she says Asiya’s hijab says “I’ll always be here” to Faizah. Ask students to consider what it means for someone to “always be there” for someone else. Use these guiding questions to support ideas and discussion:
                        <br>-What does Faizah mean when she says that Asiya’s hijab says to her “I’ll always be here”? <i>(The hijab reassures Faizah; it helps her feel proud and strong of who she and Asiya are—sisters who will always be there to help each other.)</i>
                        <br>-How does Asiya show Faizah that she will always be there for Faizah? How does that make Faizah feel?<i> (Asiya walks Faizah home, holding her hand; she looks out for Faizah; she is a good example for Faizah, too.)</i>
                            <br>-How are the sisters Noor and Haya in the video you watched earlier a good example of sisters “being there” for each other?
                            <br>-How can you show a friend or a family member that you will “always be there”?

In Part 2 of the reading, Faizah actually draws her own picture of her and Asiya as two princesses having a picnic. At the end of the story, Faizah can’t wait to show it to Mama. Students can compare the pictures they drew with Faizah’s drawing on page 18. Then students can act out a role play. Directions are included in Activity Support. </p>

                    <h3>Preparing to Present</h3>
                    <p>Provide time for student pairs to practice their presentations, reminding students that each partner should have a significant role in presenting their project. Partners should work collaboratively and follow agreed upon rules, norms, and protocols. Review the 4-Point Project Rubric with students so they understand how they will be assessed. </p>
                    <p>Explain that students can strengthen their presentations by incorporating different types of media, such as photographs, drawings, and videos. Model how to present orally.</p>

                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>When I present, I make eye contact with the audience. I don’t keep my eyes down.  
                        </li>
                        <li>As I speak, I make sure everyone in the room can hear what I am saying.</li>
                        <li>I pronounce each of my words clearly and correctly.</li>
                        <li>I do not rush through my presentation, but speak clearly and at a natural pace.</li>
                    </ul>

                                <p>
                                    Faizah and older sister Asiya accompany their mother to the hijab store to pick out Asiya’s first-day hijab. The next day is the girls’ first day back to school, and it will be sixth grader Asiya’s first time wearing hijab at school. Asiya picks a beautiful blue hijab, which Faizah admires. The next day, the sisters arrive at school—Faizah feeling special with a new backpack and light-up shoes, and Asiya wearing her “proudest blue” hijab.</p>
                                <p>
                                    When school-yard bullies hurl insults at Asiya, the “proudest blue” of her hijab gives her the strength and sense of self to ignore the hurtful words. Asiya’s resilience comforts a confused and upset Faizah, who sees in Asiya’s actions a model for dealing with intolerance.</p>
                               
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Theme Overview </h2>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold"> Hijab and Pride in Self, Family, and Culture</span> In this story, hijab is a symbol of cultural and familial pride—a source of strength for both sisters. Hijab is a traditional scarf, or head covering, worn by many Muslim women around the world. Exact practices, including the age when women begin wearing hijab, vary among different groups, often by region, sect, or family tradition. The author’s note provides more details on the practice, including Ibtihaj Muhammad’s personal experience wearing hijab. Muhammad’s cultural and religious pride are reflected throughout the story, as Faizah recalls their mother’s words of wisdom, reinforcing lessons of dignity and pride. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold"> Meeting Bullying with Resilience </span> Asiya encounters taunts about her hijab from faceless school-yard bullies. The younger Faizah witnesses the bullying, which confuses, angers, and scares her. Asiya, however, ignores the bullying with quiet resilience, and proves to be a role model for her sister. The “proudest blue” hijab is a source of strength for both girls as they learn to be resilient in the face of prejudice and ignorance.
                                </p>
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Sensitivity Issues </h2>

                                <p><span class="bold">Bullying</span> The story’s central conflict is bullying by other students in a school playground. The illustrations depict the bullies as faceless, dark forms. Be extra sensitive to students’ reactions, and keep in mind that some of your students may have experienced or witnessed bullying. Muslim students in particular may have strong reactions to the events, as one of two Muslim sisters is taunted for wearing hijab at school. For some insight into dealing with this issue, see the article from LearningforJustice.org, which shares one teacher’s experience dealing with Islamophobia in the classroom. 
                                </p>

                                <p><span class="playicon"><i class="fa fa-eye"></i></span> To locate the article, copy and paste the URL into your browser:</p>

                                <p>Finally, note that most of the bully figures in the illustrations are suggestive of male shapes, and Faizah refers to the bullies as “boys.” Some readers may conclude that most bullying is done by boys, which could be seen as a biased viewpoint on intolerance and bullying.</p>

                            <p>Begin the activity by having students recall how Milton and his friends in the Stop Bullying Now video dealt with bullying. Then have them recall what Ibtihaj Muhammad had to say about her own experience with bullying. You might share situations in your life where your own pride or sense of self helped you overcome a difficult situation. For example, “When I was in fifth grade, classmates made fun of me because they thought my singing sounded funny. I ignored them and just sang louder and prouder!”</p>

                            <li><span class="bold">1.</span>Pose this question: Why might feeling proud of who you are help you deal with a problem like bullying?</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">2.</span>Have students think about this question on their own, and then turn and talk to discuss it with a partner. Then, have partners discuss the question with the whole class. (Note that some students may not feel comfortable sharing experiences with bullying. In that case, they can discuss the question as it relates to the two videos that they viewed.)</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">3.</span> Prompt the whole class discussion with guiding questions such as the following: </li>

                               <li>How does Faizah feel when she first hears the bully laughing at Asiya? Why? <i> (Faizah doesn’t understand it; she asks why; she can’t understand why others don’t see Asiya’s hijab the same way she does—proud and beautiful.)</i></li>
                               <li>How are Faizah’s reactions to the bullying different from Asiya’s? <i> (Asiya and her friends calmly go back to playing tag; Faizah gets mad.)</i></li>
                               <li>What might Faizah learn from Asiya about dealing with bullies? How does feeling proud help both girls? <i> (Faizah learns to stay proud of herself and ignore the bullies. This helps both Asiya and Faizah let go of the hurtful words.)</i></li>
                                <li>Have you ever had to overcome a big challenge like this? How did it make you feel about yourself?</li>
